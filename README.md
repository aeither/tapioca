### Description

The Solana blockchain currently has limited usage beyond the cryptocurrency industry, despite its superior speed and cost-effectiveness. However, it has the potential to be utilized for everyday expenses such as dining out. As more people transition to using crypto wallets for their finances, there are several challenges that consumers may encounter.
- To use a crypto debit card, we first need to transfer tokens from our non-custodial wallet to an exchange and then load them onto the card.
- Credit/debit card fees can add up quickly, especially for businesses like restaurants that process a high volume of transactions each year. Even a small percentage of the total can amount to a significant cost.
